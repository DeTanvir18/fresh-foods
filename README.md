I have made this react project for food lovers. It is a meal serving site for the company "The Fresh Foods Inc". Of course, it's dynamic. A visitor can:
* See the the latest and demanding meal recipes specially recipes from western world
* After seeing the recipes, one can see the the details of that recipe
* After seeing the details, a user can request for that meal
* Visitors can also like and comment in any meal from both showings and upcomings 
* They can see the meals they requested for
* They can search the meals they wanted for
* They can buy and hold any of the silver, gold and platinum packages
* It is responsive, so he can use and see updates from mobile
* So, find, search & request meals according to their demands
